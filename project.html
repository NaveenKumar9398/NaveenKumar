  This project is a responsive clone of the Amazon homepage built using
  <b>HTML and CSS</b>. It uses <b>Flexbox</b> and <b>CSS Grid</b> for layout
  structuring, along with modern CSS properties for spacing, alignment, and
  responsiveness. Media queries were implemented to ensure the design adapts
  smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The project focuses on
  recreating key UI components such as the navigation bar, product listings,
  banners, and footer while maintaining visual consistency. Through this
  project, I strengthened my understanding of responsive design, layout
  techniques, and clean UI development.

<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Responsive Layout Design:</b>
    Recreating the Amazon homepage layout while maintaining responsiveness
    across multiple screen sizes was challenging. This was addressed using a
    combination of Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries to ensure consistent
    alignment and spacing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Complex Header Structure:</b>
    Building the navigation bar with multiple elements such as the logo,
    search bar, menus, and icons required careful layout planning and proper
    use of flex properties to maintain balance and responsiveness.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>UI Consistency:</b>
    Matching the visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography of the original
    design was challenging. This was solved by using reusable CSS classes and
    maintaining uniform margins, paddings, and font styles throughout the page.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Cross-Device Compatibility:</b>
    Ensuring the design looked correct on different devices and screen
    resolutions required testing and fine-tuning breakpoints to avoid layout
    breaking or overflow issues.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Clean Code Management:</b>
    
      Managing a large CSS file without a framework was challenging, so the
      styles were organized logically to improve readability and
      maintainability.
    
  </li>
</ul>
